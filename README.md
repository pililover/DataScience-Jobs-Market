### 1.2 Project's objectives:
- Analyze the top trending spotify music data.
- Presenting the findings in a way that provides insights into local music preferences.

### 1.3 Project's purpose 
- The Vietnamese music industry has significant growth in 2024, with a surge in both quantity and quality of music products. This project uses Spotify data to better understand the changing tastes of Vietnamese listeners. By identifying popular songs, albums, and new trends, the project will provide useful insights to help industry professionals, artists, and fans stay updated on current music preferences.

### 1.4 Project's plan
We planned and discussed the problems together, then record it at Trello (https://trello.com/invite/b/677049104337e628b16d8c89/ATTI66cd9ebf43140e6abfe1262d5faf8237147BBF37/introdsspotify-rewind-2024).

## 2. Reflections
### **Difficulties Encountered**
- During the implementation of this project, we encountered many obstacles. One of them was the difficulty in finding open data sources to be able to get a lot of useful attribute information for analysis and drawing conclusions for the target question. In addition, the work of handling the dynamics of the website and automating the data collection process over many months was also a major obstacle in the implementation process. Considering how to ask meaningful questions also took the team a lot of time to implement. Regarding the model, choosing the appropriate models to predict and using what metrics to evaluate them was also a difficulty.

### **Lessons Learned**
- Through this project, we learned how to organize and divide work appropriately. Through the process of completing the project, we effectively analyzed and extracted insights from raw datasets. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in managing our time efficiently for each phase of the project.

### **Future Improvements**
- If our group had more time, we would have liked to delve deeper into the dataset to uncover more insights and scrape more data from different sources to enrich the dataset cause we think it would be more interesting and informative. Furthermore, we would like to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the number of cases in the future.
